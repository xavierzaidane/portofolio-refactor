# AI Portfolio — Built with Google AI Studio & Gemini 3.0

This project is more than a portfolio — it’s a reflection of how I think, build, and experiment with modern AI systems.

I built this application using **Google AI Studio** and **Gemini 3.0** to explore how large language models can be integrated into real-world products, not just as demos, but as meaningful user-facing experiences. My goal was to create a portfolio that feels *alive*: interactive, intelligent, and adaptable.

Rather than presenting static information, this portfolio leverages AI to communicate my work, ideas, and problem-solving approach in a more dynamic way. It represents how I approach engineering — focusing on clarity, usability, and scalable architecture while embracing emerging technologies.

This project also serves as a sandbox for learning:
- Designing AI-driven user experiences
- Integrating Gemini models into production-ready workflows
- Structuring clean, maintainable, and deployable applications
- Balancing experimentation with professional engineering standards
