## Why I Refactored My Portfolio

As I grew as a developer, I realized my old portfolio no longer represented how I think, build, and solve problems today. It showcased *what* I had done, but not *how* or *why* I do it.

This refactor was driven by a simple question:  
**How can my portfolio communicate my mindset, not just my projects?**

I wanted something beyond a static website — a space that reflects curiosity, experimentation, and the way I approach modern software engineering. The result is a portfolio designed to feel intentional, expressive, and future-oriented.

## Bringing AI Into the Experience

To achieve this, I built the portfolio using **Google AI Studio** and **Gemini 3.0** to explore how large language models can be integrated into real-world products — not just as demos, but as meaningful, user-facing experiences.

My goal was to create a portfolio that feels *alive*:  
**interactive, intelligent, and adaptable.**

By embedding AI directly into the experience, this project demonstrates how modern AI can enhance communication, personalization, and engagement — turning a portfolio into something dynamic rather than static.

This portfolio is both a personal statement and a technical playground, reflecting how I build products today and how I aim to build them in the future.
